🛠️ Real-Time Data Engineering Pipeline with kafka, spark and AWS

This project builds a real-time data engineering pipeline that streams data using Apache Kafka, processes it using Apache Spark, stores it in PostgreSQL, and optionally integrates with AWS S3 for long-term storage. It's orchestrated with Apache Airflow for production-grade scheduling and monitoring.

📌 Features

🔄 Real-time data ingestion with Apache Kafka

⚡ Scalable stream processing with Apache Spark

🗃️ Data storage and transformation using PostgreSQL

☁️ Optional S3 integration for raw/processed data backup

🧩 Modular and production-ready codebase

🛠️ Airflow (optional) for job orchestration

🧱 Architecture Overview

Data Source → Kafka → Spark Streaming → PostgreSQL

This **RealTime\_Ecommerce\_Pipeline** project simulates a **real-world data engineering workflow** that processes customer purchase data from an e-commerce system in real time. Here's what the project 

**actually does**:


🧩 **Overview**

It builds a data pipeline that ingests streaming data, processes it, stores it, and prepares it for analysis or visualization — exactly like a production-grade analytics platform.


🔄 **End-to-End Workflow**

1. **📥 Kafka Producer (Ingestion)**

   * Simulates real-time customer events like purchases, page views, cart activity.
     
   * Sends the data as a continuous stream to Kafka topics.
     

2. **⚙️ Spark Streaming (Transformation)**

   * Connects to Kafka.
     
   * Consumes the real-time events and processes them:

     * Cleans data (e.g., removes nulls)
       
     * Aggregates (e.g., total sales per product or time window)
       
     * Adds enrichment (e.g., derived columns)

3. **🛢️ Storage (Sink Layer)**

   * Writes cleaned/aggregated data to:

     * **PostgreSQL** (for querying via SQL tools)
       
     * **Amazon S3** (or local file as simulated object storage)

4. **📅 Airflow (Optional: Orchestration)**

   * Defines DAGs to automate batch jobs like:

     * Daily sales summary
       
     * Customer segmentation
       
     * Data validation
       
     * Ensures all steps run in the correct order

5. **📊 Visualization-Ready Data**

   * Final output can be connected to:

     * **Amazon QuickSight**, **Tableau**, or **Power BI**
       
     * CSV exports for Excel or business reporting
     
✅ **Use Cases Simulated**

* Real-time **fraud detection**
  
* **Live sales dashboards**
  
* **Customer behavior tracking**
  
* **Campaign effectiveness analysis**

                         
🖥️ Prerequisites

Install the following:

🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the Repo

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-pipeline.git

cd data-pipeline

2. Install Python Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Start Kafka Services

Terminal 1: Start Zookeeper

bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties

Terminal 2: Start Kafka Broker

bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties

4. Run Spark Streaming Job

spark-submit spark/stream_processor.py

5. Start PostgreSQL

OR use Docker

docker run -d -p 5432:5432 --name pg -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=admin postgres

6. Optional: AWS Integration

aws configure

Add your S3 bucket settings in config.py

7. Optional: Launch Airflow

cd airflow/

docker-compose up airflow-init

docker-compose up

🧪 Sample Kafka Producer

python kafka_producer/produce_mock_data.py

📊 Output

Live processed data stored in PostgreSQL

Historical/archived data optionally pushed to AWS S3

Visualize or query from PostgreSQL using pgAdmin or CLI
